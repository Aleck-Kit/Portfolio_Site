        "bio": "I was Born in Bordeaux, Cultured by Congo, Nurtured by Nairobi, Galvanised by Gaborone,  Woken by Windhoek and sent off to face the world as a young adult by South Africa. As you've probably already guessed, that's a bunch of air miles. But if there's anything I've garnered from all of that travel, it is a profound appreciation of the power that simple communication between people can play in solving even the seemingly hardest problems in the world. And I look to do my part. One MERN stack line of code at a time.",
